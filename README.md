# Sign Language Interpreter

This project provides a sign language interpreter powered by Python. It is designed to process sign language data and translate it into text.

## Requirements

- **Python Version**: Python 3.8 is required for compatibility with the libraries used.
- **Libraries**:
  - `cvzone`
  - `mediapipe`
  - `tensorflow`

## Project Structure

The project includes two main scripts and a set of test images that demonstrate the functionality of the interpreter:

- **Data Collection Script**: Captures sign language data for training and evaluation.
- **Data Processing Script**: Processes and transforms the collected data to prepare it for model training and testing.

## Demo Images

Here are some screenshots showing the interpreter in action:
